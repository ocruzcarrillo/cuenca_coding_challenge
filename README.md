# Cuenca - coding challenge
### ISC Omar CC

Here's the programming problem: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle)


# N Queens Puzzle

These are the different aspect of the project you can work on (in order):

1. Determine all possible solutions for a given N where N â‰¥ 8 (within 10 mins on a laptop). Bonus points for a higher N where N is the size of the board / number of queens

2. Tterate over N and store the solutions in postgres using SQLAlchemy

3. Write basic tests that at least verify the number of solutions for a given N match what's online. I recommend using pytest

4. Docker-ize the solution, so that I can run the code and tests without any assumption of my local setup (including running a postgres instance in docker-compose)

5. Setup Travis CI (or similar) for your public GitHub repo to run the tests automatically

  

You don't need to go through all of the steps, but there should be instructions on how I can run the code. I mainly want to see how you approach a problem and your coding style. There are multiple steps so you have the option to show me different skills. It's up to you.
